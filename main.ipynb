    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the relationships between the physical and genetic characteristics of various soybean cultivars and two main indicators of productivity: thousand seed weight (MHG) and grain yield (GY). This project aims to develop predictive models for MHG and to identify clusters of cultivars with similar characteristics, thereby improving the selection of cultivars and cultivation practice, using a dataset that includes information on plant characteristics, as well as climatic conditions and soil properties from the data documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Description**: A detailed description of the dataset and variables.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: The methods used for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.\n",
    "4. **Predictive Modeling for MHG**:\n",
    "    - Creating synthetic data for testing.\n",
    "    - Selection and training of models.\n",
    "    - Experimentation and hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
    "5. **Clustering of Soybean Cultivars**: Techniques and results of clustering.\n",
    "6. **Evaluation and Comparison of Models**: Methods and metrics for evaluation.\n",
    "7. **Conclusions**: Summarizing findings and recommendations for agricultural practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem-Solving Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The project adopts a two-stage approach to addressing the specified problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a detailed exploratory analysis will be conducted to understand the correlations between variables and their impact on MHG and GY. This stage aims to address the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the most important factors in determining MHG (Thousand seed weight)?\n",
    "2. What are the most important factors in determining GY (Grain yield)?\n",
    "3. What is the delta in MHG and GY from Season 1 to Season 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the focus will be on developing the predictive model for MHG, using existing data and synthetic datasets generated to test the model's ability to generalize. Machine learning algorithms will be explored, with the best-performing models selected based on specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, the project will implement clustering techniques to identify groups of soybean cultivars with similar characteristics, facilitating a deep understanding of genetic diversity and production potential.\n"

    "The dataset for this project encompasses a collection of measurements and characteristics of soybean plants cultivated across two different planting seasons. The data includes information on physical plant traits, production performance, details about the cultivated soybean varieties, as well as data on environmental conditions and soil properties where the plants were grown.\n",

    "- **Season**: A numeric indicator (1 or 2) distinguishing between the two planting seasons for which data were collected. This variable reflects different timing and possible climatic variations between seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cultivar**: Categorical names of the 40 soybean varieties planted. Each variety possesses its own genetic characteristics that can influence growth, development, and yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repetition**: The number of replications (1-4) for each variety in each season, indicating that data for each variety and season were collected multiple times to ensure the reliability of the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **NGL (Number of Grains per Plant)**: The total number of grains produced by a plant, determined through manual counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NS (Number of Grains per Pod)**: The number of grains found in a single pod, determined through manual counting.\n",
